We highly recommend that you read through these notes with some rough paper handy and actively engage with the example questions. Resources linked to these examples will be made available throughout the year, but these examples work best when you attempt them before reviewing the worked solutions.\nThe best predictor of your final OV1114 grade is how engaged you are with the course. Students who attempt all of the examples and engage with the resources each week perform significantly better in all assessments.\nWe have honestly enjoyed constructing this course, we hope you enjoy it too.\nM.

    "text": "History\nThe optometric physic module started in 2018 and the module was co-created, co-designed, and co-implemented by Marisa Rodríguez Carmona and Benjamin Evans. The module is designed to provide an introduction to physics, its application and significance in optometry, and the basic optical knowledge necessary for studying the human eye. By successfully completing the optometric physics module you will ensure you have the foundation required to understand more complex concepts in optics and visual optics.\nFor the first three years of the course (2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21) theoretical content was described in both lectures and ‘tutorial’ sessions. In the summer of 2021 the module content and structure was broken down and remoulded into holistic Nodes by Benjamin Evans. These notes were created at the same time to serve as the kernel of the module. While the original notes were based purely upon lectures and tutorials, given by Marisa Rodríguez Carmona and Benjamin Evans respectively, they continue to evolve each year. In its current iteration the module is run by Benjamin Evans & Marisa Rodríguez Carmona.",

As such, scientific notation is written using E notation. This is where En (or sometimes lowercase e) represents “times 10 raised to the power \\(n\\)”. Mathematically: \\[\na\\textrm{E}\\,n \\equiv a \\times 10^{n}\n\\]\nFor example, \\[\n    \\texttt{3.57E4} \\equiv 3.57 * 10^4\n\\] \\[\n    \\texttt{9.1E-31} \\equiv 9.1 \\times 10^{-31}\n\\] \\[\n    \\texttt{1.055e-34} \\equiv 1.055 \\times 10^{-34}\n\\] So if, when using a computer, if you see text such as, 3.02e+2 or 3.02E+2 know that it is equivalent to \\(3.02 \\times 10^{2}.\\)\nThis E notation is used to represent large or small numbers more efficiently in computations and data storage. This notation is also referred to as scientific notation in software such as Microsoft Excel.",

    "section": "1.5 Rounding and significant figures",
    "text": "1.5 Rounding and significant figures\nYou will be expected to know how to round to a given number of decimal places or significant figures. In the optometric physics module the standard rules for rounding apply:\n\nIf the digit to be dropped is greater or equal to 5, the last retained digit is increased by one\nIf the digit to be dropped is less than 5, the last remaining digit is left as it is\n\n\n1.5.1 What is a significant figure?\nA significant figure (often abbreviated to s.f.) is any digit in a number that carries meaningful information about its precision. Significant figures are a way of expressing the level of accuracy behind a measurement.\nThe number of significant figures in a result is the number of figures that are known with some degree of reliability. For example, the number 13.2 is said to have 3 significant figures (1, 3, and 2) and the number 13.20 is said to have 4 significant figures (1, 3, 2, and 0). Note that any zero after the first significant digit is significant.\n\n\n1.5.2 Rules for significant figures\nThere are several rules used to determine which digits are significant:\n\nAll nonzero digits are significant (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9)\nZeroes between nonzero digits are significant (e.g., the zeros in 403, 30004, and 20.02 are significant)\nZeroes to the left of the first nonzero digits are not significant; such zeros merely indicate the position of the decimal point (e.g., the zeros in 0.03 and 0.0042 are not significant)\nZeroes to the right of a decimal point in a number are significant (e.g. the zeros in 38.00 are significant)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that trailing zeros in a whole number without a decimal point are not necessarily significant.\n\n\nA value of 100 could have one, two, or three significant figures depending on how it’s measured or written (e.g., 100.0 would have four significant figures, while 100 may have only one, if it’s an estimate or if the instrument you are using only measures to the nearest 100).\n\n\n1.5.3 Examples\n\n1.234 g has 4 significant figures\n3.0002 kg has 5 significant figures\n0.001\\(^\\circ\\)C has 1 significant figure\n0.200g has 3 significant figures\n\\(5.060 \\times 10^{4}\\) (\\(\\equiv\\) 50,600) has 4 significant figures\n5.67E+12 (\\(\\equiv\\) 5,670,000,000,000) has 3 significant figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf not specified in the question give your answer in full and then round your answer to 3 significant figures on the line below.\n\n\n\n\n1.5.4 Questions - Rounding\n\nRound \\(4.312728302\\) to four significant figures\nRound \\(6.0067343\\times 10^{-4}\\) to three significant figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\; 4.313\\) (4sf)\n\n\\(\\; 6.01 \\times 10^{-4}\\) (3sf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn OV1114, we never round to fewer than 3 significant figures, and rounding should only be done at the final step of a calculation. Use full precision throughout multi-step problems. For example, if step 1 gives 2.54832, do not round to 2.54 before step 2 — continue using the full value.",
