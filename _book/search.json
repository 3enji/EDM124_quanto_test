We highly recommend that you read through these notes with some rough paper handy and actively engage with the example questions. Resources linked to these examples will be made available throughout the year, but these examples work best when you attempt them before reviewing the worked solutions.\nThe best predictor of your final OV1114 grade is how engaged you are with the course. Students who attempt all of the examples and engage with the resources each week perform significantly better in all assessments.\nWe have honestly enjoyed constructing this course, we hope you enjoy it too.\nM.

    "text": "History\nThe optometric physic module started in 2018 and the module was co-created, co-designed, and co-implemented by Marisa Rodríguez Carmona and Benjamin Evans. The module is designed to provide an introduction to physics, its application and significance in optometry, and the basic optical knowledge necessary for studying the human eye. By successfully completing the optometric physics module you will ensure you have the foundation required to understand more complex concepts in optics and visual optics.\nFor the first three years of the course (2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21) theoretical content was described in both lectures and ‘tutorial’ sessions. In the summer of 2021 the module content and structure was broken down and remoulded into holistic Nodes by Benjamin Evans. These notes were created at the same time to serve as the kernel of the module. While the original notes were based purely upon lectures and tutorials, given by Marisa Rodríguez Carmona and Benjamin Evans respectively, they continue to evolve each year. In its current iteration the module is run by Benjamin Evans & Marisa Rodríguez Carmona.",

In standard form, numbers are written as\n\\[\na \\times 10^{n}\n\\]\nwhere \\(1 \\leq a &lt; 10\\) and \\(n\\) is an integer (a whole number). For example, \\[\\begin{align*}\n    3.57 \\times 10^{4} & = (3.57) \\times (10^{4}) \\\\\n    3.57 \\times 10^{4} & = (3.57) \\times (10,000) \\\\\n    3.57 \\times 10^{4} & = 35,700\n\\end{align*}\\]\nOr, as entered into a computer: 3.57*10^(4) = 35,700\nIn many computer systems superscript exponents \\(\\left(10^{4}\\right)\\) can be inconvenient to display. As such, scientific notation is written using E notation. This is where E (or sometimes lowercase e) represents “times 10 raised to the power”. Mathematically: \\[\na\\textrm{E}\\,n \\equiv a \\times 10^{n}\n\\]\nFor example, \\[\n    \\texttt{3.57E4} \\equiv 3.57 \\times 10^4\n\\] \\[\n    \\texttt{9.1E-31} \\equiv 9.1 \\times 10^{-31}\n\\] \\[\n    \\texttt{1.055e-34} \\equiv 1.055 \\times 10^{-34}\n\\] So when working on a computer, if you come across text like 3.02e+2 or 3.02E+2, understand that it means \\(3.02 \\times 10^{2}\\). Likewise, 1.60E-19 is the same as \\(1.60 \\times 10^{-19}\\).\nThis E notation is used to represent large or small numbers more efficiently in computations and data storage. This notation is also referred to as scientific notation in software such as Microsoft Excel.",

    "text": "1.5 Rounding and significant figures\nYou will be expected to know how to round to a given number of decimal places or significant figures. In the optometric physics module the standard rules for rounding apply:\n\nIf the digit to be dropped is greater or equal to 5, the last retained digit is increased by one\nIf the digit to be dropped is less than 5, the last remaining digit is left as it is\n\n\n1.5.1 What is a significant figure?\nA significant figure (often abbreviated to s.f.) is any digit in a number that carries meaningful information about its precision. Significant figures are a way of expressing the level of accuracy behind a measurement.\nThe number of significant figures in a result is the number of figures that are known with some degree of reliability. For example, the number 13.2 is said to have 3 significant figures (1, 3, and 2) and the number 13.20 is said to have 4 significant figures (1, 3, 2, and 0). Note that any zero after the first significant digit is significant.\n\n\n1.5.2 Rules for significant figures\nThere are several rules used to determine which digits are significant:\n\nAll nonzero digits are significant (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9)\nZeroes between nonzero digits are significant (e.g., the zeros in 403, 30004, and 20.02 are significant)\nZeroes to the left of the first nonzero digits are not significant; such zeros merely indicate the position of the decimal point (e.g., the zeros in 0.03 and 0.0042 are not significant)\nZeroes to the right of a decimal point in a number are significant (e.g. the zeros in 38.00 are significant)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that trailing zeros in a whole number without a decimal point are not necessarily significant.\n\n\nA value of 100 could have one, two, or three significant figures depending on how it’s measured or written (e.g., 100.0 would have four significant figures, while 100 may have only one, if it’s an estimate or if the instrument you are using only measures to the nearest 100).\n\n\n1.5.3 Examples\n\n1.234 g has 4 significant figures\n3.0002 kg has 5 significant figures\n0.001\\(^\\circ\\)C has 1 significant figure\n0.200g has 3 significant figures\n\\(5.060 \\times 10^{4}\\) (\\(\\equiv\\) 50,600) has 4 significant figures\n5.67E+12 (\\(\\equiv\\) 5,670,000,000,000) has 3 significant figures\n\nIf not specified in the question give your answer in full and then round your answer to 3 significant figures on the line below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions - Rounding\n\n\n\n\nRound \\(4.312728302\\) to four significant figures\nRound \\(6.0067343\\times 10^{-4}\\) to three significant figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerical solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\; 4.313\\) (4sf)\n\n\\(\\; 6.01 \\times 10^{-4}\\) (3sf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn OV1114, we never round to fewer than 3 significant figures, and rounding should only be done at the final step of a calculation. Use full precision throughout multi-step problems. For example, if step 1 gives 2.54832, do not round to 2.54 before step 2 — continue using the full value.",

In the late 19th century James Clerk Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields travel in the manner of waves and that those waves essentially move at the speed of light. This allowed Maxwell to predict that light itself was carried by electromagnetic waves, which means light is a form of electromagnetic radiation.\nThese waves transport energy through empty space - there is a propagation of light. All electromagnetic waves are transverse, this means that the two components, the electric and the magnetic component, oscillate perpendicular to the direction of propagation.\nMathematically, electromagnetic radiation is a travelling wave of oscillating electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields:\n\\[\nE(x,t) = E_{0} \\sin{(kx - \\omega t)}\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\n\\[\nB(x,t) = B_{0} \\sin{(kx - \\omega t)}\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\n\\[\nE(x,t)/B(x,t) = c\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\nNote: You don’t need to learn these equations (Equation 2.1, Equation 2.2, and Equation 2.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nIn physics, a `field’ is a physical quantity, represented by a scalar, vector, or tensor, that has a value for each point in space and time.\nA physical quantity is a physical property of a material or system that can be quantified by measurement and expressed as a algebraic multiplication of a ‘Numerical value’ and a ‘Unit’ (for example temperature, wind velocity, or the force an electric charge would experience [used to infer the electric field]).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou are expected to know (& recall from memory) that the speed of light in vacuum \\(c\\) is equal to \\(3 \\times 10^{8} \\; \\textrm{m/s}\\)\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Examples of Scalar and Vector Fields\n\n2.1.2.1 Temperature (Scalar Field)\nEach point in this field has a scalar value that we can measure and record at each point in space and time (in this case with units of degrees Celsius).

In wave optics the wave nature of light must be taken into account.\nSee Node 8 and Node 9.\n\n\n2.2.3 Quantum Optics\nQuantum Optics deals with the interaction of light with matter on the atomic scale. Here the wavelength of light is very much larger than the dimension of the entities with which it interacts. Quantum optics is used to approach topics such as the photoelectric effect, lasers, and photodetectors.\nIn optometry one rarely studies quantum optics, primarily due to the fact that it’s conceptually challenging, requires advanced mathematics (a common phobia amongst optometrists), and has minimal practical relevance in a clinical setting. Although it is unlikely you will ever encounter the theoretical side of quantum optics during your optometry degree, it is a fascinating subject and the study of quantum optics has led to several key developments and several Nobel prizes awarded in 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2012.

    "text": "2.3 The Electromagnetic Spectrum\nElectromagnetic radiation takes many forms such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, x-rays, and gamma rays. Sunlight is also a form of electromagnetic energy. Visible light is only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which contains a broad range of electromagnetic wavelengths. White light is composed of a combination of wavelengths and, as a result, is said to be polychromatic.\nLet’s look at the different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum in more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: The electromagnetic spectrum from highest energy/shortest wavelength (left) to lowest energy/longest wavelength (right).\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Gamma rays\nGamma rays can be used in medical treatment applications. They ionise living tissue causing radiation-induced cellular damage, threatening healthy and diseased tissues alike. Gamma rays can kill bacteria and cancer cells and they have been used to treat certain types of cancer. Gamma rays have also been used to sterilise equipment as an alternative to chemical treatments.\n\n\n2.3.2 X-rays\nThe most familiar use of x-rays is checking for broken bones, but x-rays are also used in other ways, for example, chest x-rays can spot pneumonia. When you have an x-ray you wear a lead apron to protect certain parts of your body.\n\n\n2.3.3 Ultraviolet (UV)\nUltraviolet rays can be used to kill microbes and food and drug companies use ultraviolet lamps to sterilise their products. Suitable doses of ultraviolet rays cause the body to produce vitamin D and this is used by some doctors to treat vitamin D deficiency and some skin disorders.\n\n\n2.3.4 Visible light\nThe cones in our eyes are receivers for these tiny visible light waves. The sun is a natural source for visible light waves and our eyes see the reflection of this sunlight off the objects around us. Visible light is characterised by having a specific range of wavelengths between ~380nm-740nm.\n\n\n2.3.5 Infrared (IR)\nInfrared light waves are used to change channels on your tv, also for security lights and for burglar alarms.\n\n\n2.3.6 Microwaves\nMicrowave radiation, high frequency radio-waves, can be used in communications and in microwave ovens to heat food by rotating water molecules (a mechanism known as dipole rotation).\n\n\n2.3.7 Radio waves\nNaturally occurring radio-waves are made by lightning or by astronomical objects. Artificially generated radio-waves are used for fixed and mobile ratio communication broadcasting, radar and other navigation systems, communication satellites, computer networks and innumerable other applications.",
