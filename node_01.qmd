## Indices

Indices are introduced in the Quantitative Methods for Optometry module (OV1115) and are used extensively in the Optometric Physics (OV1114) module.

![Indices include a base and a power/index/exponent.](./figures/node01_indicesBaseExp.jpg){#fig-base-power fig-alt="The base and exponent that make up an index or power."}

The term $a^{b}$ represents the number $a$ being multiplied by itself $b$
times.

$$
\begin{aligned}
a^3   &= 1 \times a \times a \times a \\
a^1   &= 1 \times a \\
a^{8} &= 1 \times a \times a \times a \times a \times a \times a \times a \times a
\end{aligned}
$$

**Rules of indices:**

$$
a^p \times a^q = a^{p+q} 
$$ {#eq-indicesR1}

$$
a^p \div a^q = a^{p - q} 
$$ {#eq-indicesR2}

$$
(a^p)^q = a^{p \cdot q} 
$$ {#eq-indicesR3}

$$
a^{-p} = \frac{1}{a^p} 
$$ {#eq-indicesR4}

$$
a^0 = 1 
$$ {#eq-indicesR5}

$$
a^{1/p} = \sqrt[p]{a} 
$$ {#eq-indicesR6}

$$
a^{p/q} = \sqrt[q]{a^p} 
\quad \text{or} \quad 
\left( \sqrt[q]{a} \right)^p
$$ {#eq-indicesR7}

<!-- @eq-indicesR1 is an  -->

::: {.callout-important}
These rules can be applied to all rational exponents
:::

When using a computer it is not always possible to use the same symbols and
notations as when writing by hand. The following alternative notation is used
instead:

<!-- \begin{equation*}
	\verb|a^(3) = 1*a*a*a|
\end{equation*} -->
$a^{3} =$ `1*a*a*a`

Therefore our rules of indices would be written (or typed) as:

::: {.table-scroll}
| Label  | Equation | Code Notation |
|------|----------|---------------|
| @eq-indicesR1 | $a^p \times a^q = a^{p+q}$  | `(a^p)*(a^q) = a^(p+q)`   |
| @eq-indicesR2 | $a^p \div a^q = a^{p - q}$  | `(a^p)/(a^q) = a^(pâˆ’q)`   |
| @eq-indicesR3 | $(a^p)^q = a^{p \cdot q}$   | `(a^p)^q = a^(p*q)`       |
| @eq-indicesR4 | $a^{-p} = \frac{1}{a^p}$    | `a^(-p) = 1/(a^p)`        |
| @eq-indicesR5 | $a^0 = 1$                   | `a^0 = 1`                 |
| @eq-indicesR6 | $a^{1/p} = \sqrt[p]{a}$     | `a^(1/p) = sqrt[p](a)`    |
| @eq-indicesR7 | $a^{p/q} = \sqrt[q]{a^p}$   | `a^(p/q) = sqrt[q](a^p)`  |
:::

Note the use of an asterisk (*) to represent multiplication, which avoids
confusion with the letter $x$, and a forward slash (/) to indicate division. 

A central dot ($\cdot$) is also sometimes used to denote multiplication in
mathematical typesetting ($a \cdot b$ means the same as $a \ast b$).

$$
a \cdot b 
\equiv
a \ast b
\equiv
a \times b
$$

::: {.callout-caution}
Be careful not to confuse the central dot with the decimal point, which sits
on the baseline, as in $3.14$. For example:
$$
	2.5 \cdot 3.4 = 8.5
$$
:::

```{r, echo=FALSE}
a <- 2.5
# b <- round(runif(1, min = 2.4, max = 6.8), 1)
b <- round(runif(1, min = 4, max = 8))
result <- a * b
```

::: {.callout-important title="Check your understanding" .webex-check .webex-box}

`r a` $\cdot$ `r b` = `r fitb(result)`

```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
opts <- c(
  "add the bases and multiply the exponents",
  answer = "keep the base the same and add the exponents",
  "multiply the bases and exponents together"
)

cat("When you simplify $a^3 \\times a^4$, you:", longmcq(opts))
```

*Note: this is the only time we ever use the division symbol $(\div)$ in
this module. For clarity, division will typically be represented using a
forward slash (/) or a fraction, e.g., $1/2$ or $\frac{1}{2}$.*

## Standard form

Standard form may be used to express any decimal number and it is commonly used
to express very large and very small numbers. In standard form, numbers are
written as

$$
a \times 10^{n} 
$$

where $1 \leq a < 10$ and $n$ is an integer (a whole number). 
For example,
\begin{align*}
	3.57 \times 10^{4} & = (3.57) \times (10^{4}) \\
	3.57 \times 10^{4} & = (3.57) \times (10,000) \\
	3.57 \times 10^{4} & = 35,700
\end{align*}

Or, as entered into a computer: `3.57*10^(4) = 35,700`

In many computer systems superscript exponents $\left(10^{4}\right)$ can be
inconvenient to display.  As such, scientific notation is written using E
notation.  This is where `E` (or sometimes lowercase `e`) represents 
"times 10 raised to the power". Mathematically:
$$
a\textrm{E}\,n \equiv a \times 10^{n}
$$

For example,
$$
	\texttt{3.57E4} \equiv 3.57 \times 10^4
$$
$$
	\texttt{9.1E-31} \equiv 9.1 \times 10^{-31}
$$
$$
	\texttt{1.055e-34} \equiv 1.055 \times 10^{-34}
$$
So when working on a computer, if you come across text like `3.02e+2` or `3.02E+2`, understand that it means $3.02 \times 10^{2}$. Likewise, `1.60E-19` is the same as $1.60 \times 10^{-19}$.

This `E` notation is used to represent large or small numbers more efficiently in computations and data storage. This notation is also referred to as _scientific_ notation in software such as Microsoft Excel.  

## SI prefixes

SI prefixes are metric prefixes that were standardised for use in the  
International System of Units (SI) (from the French name: *SystÃ¨me International d'unitÃ©s*).

You may be familiar with some of these prefixes from units such as  
**centi**metres, **millimetres**, **kilo**metres, **giga**bytes, and **nano**metres.

### Table: SI Prefixes

{#tbl-prefixes}
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
You need to learn the prefixes shown in @tbl-prefixes.
:::

## Units

The SI prefixes can be applied to any metric unit, including grams (g)
and metres (m). A **kilo**gram is $1000$ or $1\times 10^{3}$
grams and one **nano** metre is 0.000 000 001 or $1\times 10^{-9}$ metres.

As you can see, it is far easier to use the SI prefixes and standard form when
working with very large and very small values! 

Many optometric physics problems require some form of unit conversion and it's
important to ensure that you are able to convert between the units and prefixes
shown in @tbl-prefixes.

## Rounding and significant figures

You will be expected to know how to round to a given number of decimal places or significant figures. In the optometric physics module the standard rules for rounding apply:

- If the digit to be dropped is greater or equal to 5, the last retained
	    digit is increased by one
- If the digit to be dropped is less than 5, the last remaining digit is
	    left as it is

### What is a significant figure?
A significant figure (often abbreviated to s.f.) is any digit in a number that carries meaningful information about its precision. Significant figures are a way of expressing the level of accuracy behind a measurement.


The number of significant figures in a result is the number of figures that are known with some degree of reliability. For example, the number 13.2 is said to have 3 significant figures (1, 3, and 2) and the number 13.20 is said to have 4 significant figures (1, 3, 2, and 0). Note that any zero after the first significant digit is significant.

### Rules for significant figures
There are several rules used to determine which digits are significant:


1. All nonzero digits are significant (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9)
1. Zeroes between nonzero digits are significant (e.g., the zeros in 403,
30004, and 20.02 are significant)
1. Zeroes to the left of the first nonzero digits are not significant;
such zeros merely indicate the position of the decimal point (e.g., the
zeros in 0.03 and 0.0042 are not significant)
1. Zeroes to the right of a decimal point in a number are significant
(e.g.\ the zeros in 38.00 are significant)

::: {.callout-warning}
Note that trailing zeros in a whole number without a decimal point are not necessarily significant.
:::

A value of 100 could have one, two, or three significant figures depending on how it's measured or written (e.g., 100.0 would have four significant figures, while 100 may have only one, if it's an estimate or if the instrument you are using only measures to the nearest 100).

### Examples

- 1.234 g has 4 significant figures
- 3.0002 kg has 5 significant figures
- 0.001$^\circ$C has 1 significant figure
- 0.200g has 3 significant figures
- $5.060 \times 10^{4}$ ($\equiv$ 50,600) has 4 significant figures
- `5.67E+12` ($\equiv$ 5,670,000,000,000) has 3 significant figures

If not specified in the question give your answer in full
and then round your answer to **3 significant figures** on the line below.


::: {.callout-note}
### Questions - Rounding
13. Round $4.312728302$ to four significant figures
1. Round $6.0067343\times 10^{-4}$ to three significant figures
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true title="Numerical solutions"}

13. $\; 4.313$ (4sf)  
1. $\; 6.01 \times 10^{-4}$ (3sf)

:::

::: {.callout-warning}
In OV1114, we never round to fewer than 3 significant figures, and rounding 
should only be done at the final step of a calculation. Use full precision 
throughout multi-step problems. For example, if step 1 gives 2.54832, do not 
round to 2.54 before step 2 â€” continue using the full value.

## Mathematical symbols used throughout the module 

Mathematics and physics make extensive use of symbolic notation to express 
concepts precisely and efficiently. These symbols act as a kind of shorthand 
â€” allowing us to communicate complex ideas in a compact form that is easy to 
manipulate in equations and mathematical working.

Youâ€™ll encounter a number of standard symbols throughout this module, 
including those borrowed from Greek, logic, and physical constants. 
Familiarity with these will not only help with solving problems, but also with 
interpreting derivations, experimental descriptions, and theoretical explanations.

::: {.callout-warning collapse=true title="Working"}

With any question the first step is to identify and write out the values given in the question...

##### Step 1: Write out values given in the question {.unnumbered}

$$
\begin{aligned}
v
		 & = 120 \; \textrm{furlongs per fortnight}
		\\
		 & = 120 \; \textrm{furlongs/fortnight}
		\\
		 & = 120 \; \textrm{(furlongs)}(\textrm{fortnight}^{-1})
\end{aligned}
$$

##### Step 2: Convert furlongs to metres and miles {.unnumbered}

We are told that 

$$
1 \; \textrm{furlong} = 201 \; \textrm{metres}
$$ {#eq-N1FurtoMetres}
$$
1 \; \textrm{furlong} = 0.125 \;\textrm{miles}
$$ {#eq-N1FurtoMiles}

Using @eq-N1FurtoMetres, if 1 furlong = 201 metres...

$$
\begin{aligned}
\rightarrow 120 \; \textrm{furlongs} 
  & = 120 \times 201 \; \textrm{metres}                                                                 \\
  & = 24,120 \; \textrm{metres}              \\
  & = 2.412 \times 10^{4} \; \textrm{metres}
  % \\ (&= 24.12 \; \textrm{kilometres} )%\;\; (or 24 kilometres))
\end{aligned}
$$

Using @eq-N1FurtoMiles, if 1 furlong = 0.125 miles...

$$
\begin{aligned}
\rightarrow 120 \; \textrm{furlongs}
  & = 120 \times 0.125 \; \textrm{miles} \\
  & = 15 \; \textrm{miles}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\therefore
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
120 \; \textrm{furlongs per fortnight} 
  & = 2.412 \times 10^{4} \; \textrm{metres per fortnight} \\
  & = 15 \; \textrm{miles per fortnight}
\end{aligned}
$$

_Recall from @tbl-math-symbols that $\therefore$ is a shorthand way of 
writing 'therefore'._

##### Step 3:  Convert `per fortnight' to per hour and per day {.unnumbered}

We know that

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 \; \textrm{fortnight} & = 2 \; \textrm{weeks}                                          \\
  1 \; \textrm{week}      & = 7 \; \textrm{days}                                           \\
  1 \; \textrm{day}       & = 24 \; \textrm{hours}                                         \\
  1 \; \textrm{hour}      & = 60 \; \textrm{minutes}                                       \\
  1 \; \textrm{minute}    & = 60 \; \textrm{seconds}                                       \\
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\therefore
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
1 \; \textrm{fortnight} & = 2 \; \textrm{weeks}                                          \\
                        & = 2 \times 7 \; \textrm{days}                                  \\
                        & = 2 \times 7 \times 24 \; \textrm{hours}                       \\
                        & = 2 \times 7 \times 24 \times 60 \; \textrm{minutes}           \\
                        & = 2 \times 7 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60 \; \textrm{seconds} \\
1 \; \textrm{fortnight} & = 14 \; \textrm{days}                                          \\
                        & = 336 \; \textrm{hours}                                        \\
                        & = 20,160 \; \textrm{minutes}                                   \\
                        & = 1,209,600 \; \textrm{seconds}
\end{aligned}
$$


We also know that `per' fortnight is equivalent to fortnight$^{-1}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 \; \textrm{per fortnight} 
  &= 14^{-1} \; \textrm{per day}
  \quad
  \left(
    \text{or} \; \; 
    \dfrac{1}{14} \; \; \textrm{per day}
  \right) \\
  & = 336^{-1} \; \textrm{per hour}	\nonumber      \\
  & = 20,160^{-1} \; \textrm{per minute}	\nonumber \\
  & = 1,209,600^{-1} \; \textrm{per second}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\rightarrow 
1 \; \textrm{per fortnight} = 14^{-1} \; \textrm{per day}
$$ {#eq-N1:pFN2pDay}
$$
\rightarrow 
1 \; \textrm{per fortnight} = 1,209,600^{-1} \; \textrm{per second}
$$ {#eq-N1:pFN2pSec}

##### Step 4: Convert metres per fortnight to metres per second using @{eq-N1:pFN2pSec} {.unnumbered}

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 \; \textrm{m/fortnight}
  & = {(1,209,600)}^{-1} 
    \; \textrm{m/s} \\
2.412 \times 10^{4} \; \textrm{m/fortnight}
  & = 2.412 \times 10^{4} \times {(1,209,600)}^{-1} 
    \; \textrm{m/s} \\
  & = \left(
    \dfrac{2.412 \times 10^{4}}{1.2096 \times 10^{6}}
    \right)
    \; \textrm{m/s} \\
  & = 1.9940476\ldots \times 10^{-2}
    \; \textrm{m/s} \\
  & = \underline{1.99 \times 10^{-2} \; \textrm{m/s} \; \; (\textrm{3sf})}
\end{aligned}
$$

_Underlining your final answer can make it easier to check for mistakes when you review your working._

##### Step 5: Convert miles per fortnight to miles per day using @{eq-N1:pFN2pDay} {.unnumbered}

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 \; \textrm{mile per fortnight}
    & = {(14)}^{-1} \; \textrm{miles per day}
  \\
  \rightarrow 15 \; \textrm{miles per fortnight}
    & = 15 \times {(14)}^{-1} \; \textrm{miles per day}
  \\
    & = \left( \dfrac{15}{14} \right) \; \textrm{miles per day}
  \\
    & = 1.071428571\dots \; \textrm{miles per day}
  \\
    & = \underline{1.07 \; \textrm{miles per day} \; \; (\textrm{3sf})}
\end{aligned}
$$

[
  The group covers, on average, approximately 1.07 miles every day 
  and they move at an average speed of approximately 
  $1.99 \times 10^{-2}$ ms^-1^.
